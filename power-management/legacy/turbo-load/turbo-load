# Script to automatically turn on and off turbo boost given a threshold load value

## Variables: (change as needed)
# change THRESH_PERCENT to the percent of processing power (in decimal) before turbo boost is turned on
# for example, in a 4 CPU configuration, a threshold_PERCENT of 0.5 would be when load reaches 2.0.
#    TB is turned on when load is greater than 2.0, and turned off when it is less than 2.0.
THRESH_PERCENT="0.075" #default 5% = 0.05
# value to enable toggling cpu governors as well. 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled. Default is disabled (0)
TOGGLE_GOVERNOR=0
# if you want to execute commands when reaching over or under the threshold load, set the following to commands you want to execute.
#    OVERLOAD runs when the current load goes over the threshold
#    UNDERLOAD runs when the current load goes below the threshold
OVERLOAD="powerprofilesctl set performance"
UNDERLOAD="powerprofilesctl set balanced"
