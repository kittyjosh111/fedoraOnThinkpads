#script to determine whether AC is attached, then modify a tmp file accordingly

#  This script serves as and indicator to check AC status.
#  We first create a file called "pmtoggle" in /tmp/.
#  Then, if we have an AC attached, we write the value "0" to the file.
#  Else, we write "1" to the file.

#  External scripts can then look at /tmp/pmtoggle and act accordingly.
#  For example, a script can turn on tuned's powersave profile if
#  /tmp/pmtoggle is 0, and performance if it is 1

#first, make sure the file is created
if [ -z /tmp/pmtoggle ]; then
    echo "No pmtoggle found. Creating as /tmp/pmtoggle"
    touch /tmp/pmtoggle
fi

#then, figure out AC status and assign a value to tmp file
AC=$(acpi -V | grep "off-line")
if [ ! -z "$AC" ];then
    echo "0" | tee /tmp/pmtoggle #offline
else
    echo "1" | tee /tmp/pmtoggle #online
fi
