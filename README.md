# linux-thinkpad-scripts
These are custom scripts I have used when running linux on Thinkpads. Seeing that there may be a day I need to reference these scripts or redeploy them on a new computer, this repository will hold the various scripts I have found useful.

General scripts will be under the general folder. If certain scripts were specific to one device, the folder name will be the name of the device. 


# devices and distros

The scripts were used on the following distros:
1) Fedora Linux 36

The scripts were used on the following devices:
1) Thinkpad P16 (Intel) Gen 1 (2022)
2) Thinkpad X1 Yoga (OLED) Gen 1 (2016)
