# what is this?

**Only works on GNOME**

Personally, I don't use the trackpad/touchpad because I prefer a trackpoint. However, I've seen enough people try to use the touchpad of my laptop, get really confused why nothing was working, then be forced to try using a trackpoint for the first time in their life. These people quite literally go through the 5 stages of grief:

1) Denial: They try multiple times to get the trackpad to respond, including but not limited to aggresive swiping, aggresive smashing of the touchpad, shaking the laptop, etc.

2) Anger: They get frustrated when above actions don't do anything, and they begin to ask me what's going on.

3) Bargining: I inform them of the trackpoint and nudge it a bit to show them how it works. They begin to try using it.

4) Depression: They can't control the trackpoint accurately and watch in despair as the cursor goes flying from one end to the other no matter how hard they try.

5) Acceptance: They return the laptop to me and watch as I have only slightly better control of the trackpoint than them.

Haha. It's really humorous. But I digress. Anyway:

```touchpadtoggle``` is a script to toggle the touchpad on or off. Useful if someone who doesn't know how to use a trackpoint is required to use a ThinkPad.

The most effective way to use this script is to install it to ```/usr/local/bin```, then assign a keyboard shortcut or GNOME button (like SettingsCenter) to activate the script.
