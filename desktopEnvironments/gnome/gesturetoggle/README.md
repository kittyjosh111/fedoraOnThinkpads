script to toggle gestures on or off. Useful if running with waydroid and you try to trigger an action with three or more fingers.

When using certain android apps with a touchscreen in waydroid, you may need to initiate a gesture that consists of three or more finger touches. This actually triggers the GNOME DE's builtin gestures. Thus, we create a toggle to turn on or off the GNOME builtin gestures.

Install ```disable-gestures-2021@verycrazydog.gmail.com``` from gnome extensions first
