Why does the XFCE microphone thing look so bad?

This is a genmon script to basically monitor for whether a microphone is on or off. I missed this feature from GNOME but the builtin panel indicator for XFCE looks terrible. Thus using genmon, we can jank up our own version.

Keep this script somewhere genmon can read. Set genmon peiod to a lower number for a faster icon refresh rate.
