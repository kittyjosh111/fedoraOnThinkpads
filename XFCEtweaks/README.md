I love XFCE!

Every time I try a new DE, something pisses me off about them. For example:
1) GNOME: Too buggy at times and heavy. Little customizability. Most I used it was 6 months straight.
2) KDE: Prone to breaking. Also I can't settle on a look that I look with it. Somehow has been pretty resource intensive for me. Most I used it was 2 weeks straight.
3) Mate: Actually fairly good. Would be nice if Ubuntu MATE didn't decide to break all the icons and make the DE unusable. Most I used it was 6 months straight.

Yet XFCE has its issues. It does have good customizability and a minimal philosophy though, which is what I appreciate.The scripts here are tweaks I've made for my time in XFCE. Mainly its genmon and a rotator script.

Most I've used XFCE is around 1.5 years.
