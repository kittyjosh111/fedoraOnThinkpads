On Gnome 43, Nautilus is broken with touchscreen. When scrolling on Nautilus, upon removing the finger, the right click menu appears. This is super annoying and I really dislike Nautilus. Thunar and Caja both work well with a touchscreen, but I cannot activate their right click menus.

Using this project: (https://github.com/PeterCxy/evdev-right-click-emulation), right click works using long press on touchscreen. Using this: (https://github.com/PeterCxy/evdev-right-click-emulation/issues/19), it works as a systemd service.
