1) With XFCE, I don't need the trackpoint keyboard scripts anymore, as XFCE can remember the trackpoint sensitivity from mouse settings. That is pretty useful. For now, I've set my internal trackpoint and the external keyboard one to acceleration 3.
2) On XFCE, ther is no built in auto rotate feature found in distributions like GNOME. KDE had an auto rotate script somehwere on Github. Thus, searching for and modifying a script on the internet was the only way to get XFCE working. Autorotate using provided script in this directory.
3) Oled-shmoled works phenomenally better than icc-brightness. It's responsive and actually nice to use. Use that instead of the icc scripts from now on.
