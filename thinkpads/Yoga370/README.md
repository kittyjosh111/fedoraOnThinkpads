- ```isdv4-509c.tablet``` is a custom libwacom tablet file to make this particular Yoga 370 panel recognizable as a wacom tablet. This then allows me to fix the sensitivity of my Bamboo Ink pen through GNOME's GUI.

- ```thinkfan.conf``` thinkfan config lol.

- ```tlp.conf``` is a tlp config I used that seemed to have benefits on battery life. Unused after I developed ```system76pm```.
